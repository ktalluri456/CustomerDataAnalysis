# CustomerDataAnalysis

This project focuses on using data analytics and machine learning techniques to analyze the way that people in a certain street of Austin, Texas use their energy. 

## Tools Used

We used the Tensorflow, Pandas, Random, Datetime, Sklearn, and Matplotlib Python APIs and CSV files. We used Jupyter Notebook as the IDE. 

## To Import

To import, the libraries are at the top of the code. 

## Usage

This can be used as skeleton code for pretty much any data analysis/machine learning assignment. Just make sure that you are reading the CSV file correctly and changing the parameters of the CSV accordingly. Also choose the neural network that suffices for the data.
